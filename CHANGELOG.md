# V0.11.0:
### New Features:
* Pokemon can attack in peaceful difficulty now.
* Adjust the way the range attack works, the Pokemon will gain slowness when trying to use range attack, charge for a short period of time and then attack.
    * Pokemon can't change the move it's trying to use if it's charging.
    * Moves that needs to charge 1 turn to use will have longer duration.
    * It is designed to be finished in less than 1 second so it won't influence most players.
### Changes:
* Changes some of the particle when using moves with specific types.
* Slightly adjusted the projectile created for the special move that doesn't have special effect currently to make it more accurate.
* Lowered projectiles speed. It was too fast to notice. It's still fast but you might notice something flies away.
### Bug fixes:
* Fix the bug that moves needs 1 turn to recharge/charge don't have a longer cooldown(I think it never worked so I guess no one should discover that this is a bug.)
* Fix the bug that some range attack move is not working correctly.
### TODO list:

### New Config:
* force_enable_flee: Required to be set to true for the flight feature.
* pokemon_share_yield: If this is set to true, all Pokemon that attacks the target Pokemon will get the EXP. and EV, or the last one will obtain the EXP. and EV.
* ender_dragon_has_dragon_type: (This is set to false by default) Give Ender Dragon Dragon Type when calculating the damage it takes. Please notice that the type effectiveness will be influenced by Ender Dragon's own damage reduction(check [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ender_Dragon#Behavior) for more information)
* min_xp_from_pokemon: The minimum EXP. player's Pokemon can gain from killing a Pokemon without the turn-based battle.
* max_xp_from_pokemon: The maximum EXP. player's Pokemon can gain from killing a Pokemon without the turn-based battle. If this value is lower than zero, there will be no limit.(This value is set to -1 by default)
### Changes:
* Adjusted the xp mechanic so if a Pokemon is killed by player's Pokemons, all the Pokemon that dealt damage and didn't faint will gain the EXP. and EVs, the EXP. will be affected by the Pokemon count but EVs won't be influenced.
* Make the wild Pokemon try to attack the last entity that hit it.

* force_player_battle_on_player_attack: If this is set to true, a battle will be started when a player attacks another player's Pokemon(Untested).
### Changes:
* Adjusted the Leftovers mechanic so the players can't heal the pokemon quickly by just sending them out and recalling repeatedly.
### Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the bug that the game will crash if a Pokemon tries to use a ghost type move on Cobblemon 1.7.2

# V0.10.5:

* [Nether Invader](https://modrinth.com/mod/nether-invader) will cause all the Pokemon can't attack proactively.(I'm not sure about the reason. The findClosest method of NearestVisibleLivingEntities fails to return the correct value. Might be caused by its mixin.)

# v0.10.3:
### Implemented Features:
* Added back wild Pokemon's cries and angry particles
* Added back extra speed multiplier affected by the Pokemon's speed stat.(Only usable when chasing the target currently.)
### New Config:

# V0.10.2:
### Implemented Features:
* Wild Pokemon proactive attack
### New Config:
* force_enable_defend_owner: TLDR:Allows you to solve the problem that Pokemon added by the datapacks/addons can't attack. Explanation: It set willDefendOwner to true in the Pokemon combat behaviour. So the Pokemon can be prepared for targeting entities. The datapack creators can enable this by themselves, too.
* force_enable_defend_self: TLDR:Allows you to solve the problem that Pokemon added by the datapacks/addons can't attack. It works in a similar way like the one mentioned above.

# V0.10.1:

* Fix the bug that the Pokemon won't try to approach the target if the Pokemon can see the target but it is not within the attack range if the Pokemon is using a range attack move.
### Changes:
* Increased the range attack radius.
### Known issue:
* Some Pokemon added by MSD can't use the combat behaviour I added. I'm not sure what's the reason, but I guess it's not my problem because they can't use the mechanic added by Cobblemon, too.

# V0.10.0:
## Half Reborn Update
Cobblemon 1.7 has changed a lot of things. The Brain system used in Minecraft might be easy to create complex behaviour if you build an entity from the ground up. However, it's quite hard to inject something new to a brain due to the highly immutable structure Mojang uses.  
I've tried my best to update this mod to Cobblemon 1.7 but there are still something that needs to be updated. This version doesn't have all the features already included in V0.9.0, but I still hope that you can enjoy this update.
### Implemented Features:
* FOF style melee attack and range attack.
* Pokemon will attack the target you hit.
### Some unimplemented features that you might care:
* Poke Staff can't select the target for the Pokemon currently.
* Poke Staff can't select the position you want the Pokemon to move to.
* Wild Pokemon attack the player proactively.

### Localization:
* PT_BR localization from [@PrincessStelllar](https://github.com/PrincessStelllar)

# V0.9.0:
This version is for Cobblemon 1.6 and 1.6.1! The new version for Cobblemon 1.7 will be released in a few days.  
Since Cobblemon 1.7 is released. 0.9.0 will be the last version that adds new features and supports Cobblemon 1.6.1. However, I will still fix the bugs reported before 2026.1.1 for Cobblemon 1.6.1.
### New Features:
* Quick Attack and some of the other moves with high priority will approach the target quickly if the pokemon is distant from the target and the pokemon is trying to use the move.
* Some moves can create a storm at the target position. The storm will be started after a short period of time after being created.
* Some moves can create a whirlpool at the target position. It will try to hurt the targets within the range and slow them. 
* The size of the pokemon(More accurately, the width of the bounding box of a pokemon) will influence the radius of the area of effect.
### New Config:
* quick_attack_like_move: Moves that is similar to Quick Attack, the Pokemon will approach the target quickly if it is distant from the target when the pokemon is trying to use the move.
* delayed_aoe_at_target_position: Moves that will create an area that will deal the damage to the targets after a short period of time.
* delayed_aoe_can_float: Moves that can create the area of effect in the air, if a move is included in delayed_aoe_at_target_position but it is not included in this list, the area of effect will be created on the ground below the target if the target is in the air.
* delayed_aoe_rise_up_tornado: Moves that will create a tornado after a short period of time. The storm has a much higher bounding box height compared to the whirlpool.
* delayed_aoe_bounding_whirlpool: Moves that will create a whirlpool at the target position, this whirlpool will be activated after a short period of time. Dealing damage to the targets and slowing them down.
* delayed_aoe_is_instant: Moves that will trigger its effect only on its activation.

* force_player_battle_on_player_hurt: If set to true, a battle will be started when hurt by a player's Pokemon.

### Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the bug that force_wild_battle_on_pokemon_hurt is not working correctly
# v0.6.2
This is just a build using the last commit before I was trying to update to 1.21.1. It should help to solve the problem that the forge version is behaving differently from the fabric version. It's been over 10 months so I can't remember the differences very well.
# V0.8.3
#### Attention:
The way we calculate the aggression is changed greatly. If you're enabling Pokemon's proactive attack, the Pokemon might be more/less aggressive than before. I'm sorry for any possible inconvenience I may cause, but it's an important change I have to made to make the config edit easier to understand.
### New Features:

### Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the bug that the cooldown of unselected moves is unusually fast.
* Fixed the bug that can_use_held_item is not working correctly.
