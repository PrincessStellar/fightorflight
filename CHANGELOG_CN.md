* [Nether Invader](https://modrinth.com/mod/nether-invader)会导致所有宝可梦无法主动攻击（我不是很确定的什么原因。NearestVisibleLivingEntities类的方法findClosest无法返回正确的值，可能是由它的mixin导致的。)


# v0.10.3:

Cobblemon 1.7已经发布了，0.9.0将成为最后一个支持方块宝可梦1.6.1且增加了新特性的版本。但是我仍然会修复2026.1.1之前提交的bug。
### 新特性：

* delayed_aoe_can_float: 可以在空中使用的AOE技能，如果一个技能被包括在上面但不包括在这个列表，则这些技能在攻击空中的目标时只能在它们下方的地面上使用。与之相反，如果技能在这个列表的话则可以在空中目标的位置上使用。
* delayed_aoe_rise_up_tornado: 暴风类技能。这类技能的碰撞箱的高度高于漩涡类，意味着这类技能可以更有效的攻击空中目标
* delayed_aoe_bounding_whirlpool: 漩涡类技能。伤害目标并减速。

# v0.6.2
This is just a build using the last commit before I was trying to update to 1.21.1. It should help to solve the problem that the forge version is behaving differently from the fabric version. It's been over 10 months so I can't remember the differences very well.
# V0.8.3
#### Attention:
The way we calculate the aggression is changed greatly. If you're enabling Pokemon's proactive attack, the Pokemon might be more/less aggressive than before. I'm sorry for any possible inconvenience I may cause, but it's an important change I have to made to make the config edit easier to understand.
### New Features:
* Implemented Spikes and its variations(Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock and Sticky Web)
* Player's Pokemon can throw the spikes now.
  * Stone Axe and Ceaseless Edge can create stealth rock/spikes, too.
* Status moves need to be used manually now.(Select them with the Poke Staff and right click/press the hotkey you set again)
* Using the taunt moves(Taunt, Torment, Rage Powder, Follow Me) will force the mobs targeting the owner to attack the Pokemon.
* * Reworked aggression system.
  * It is the sum of 5 values now. Most of them have an editable base value and multiplier to allow you have a deeper customization. The threshold is editable, too. More detailed information is written in the config file.(keywords that you might use when searching through the config file: aggression_level, aggression_atk_def_dif, aggression_light_level, aggression_nature, aggression_intimidation)
### Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the bug that the cooldown of unselected moves is unusually fast.
* Fixed the bug that can_use_held_item is not working correctly.
* Fixed the bug that the bullet/ball projectiles didn't explode when hitting mobs.
* Fixed the bug that the color of the bullet/ball projectiles wasn't influenced by the move's type.
* Fixed the bug that friendly fire related configs are not working as expected.
# V0.8.2
### New Features:
* If you installed LivelierPokemon, the cat Pokemon will attack Creeper proactively.(can be disabled in the config, the cat pokemon category is in livelierpokemon-categories.json5 if you installed that mod.)

* can_use_held_item_damage_influencing. If the pokemon can use damage-increasing held item
* can_use_held_item_hp_influencing. If the pokemon can use hp-restoring/damage-inflicting held item(Life Orb not included)
### Bug Fixes:
* Pokemon's explosion won't accidentally destroy gravestone from Pneumono_'s mod.(It's the only one reported in the issue, might be useful for the other blocks that shouldn't be destroyed by explosion)
# v0.8.1
### New Features:
* Added tooltip for Oran Lucky Egg
* Rocky helmet(Held Item)/Rough Skin(Ability)/Iron Barbs(Ability) hurts the attacker now.

### New Features:
- New config options: A config option to disable failed captures counted as provocation
### Fixes:
- Bug fixes:Fix the bug that health_sync_for_wild_pokemon is disabled when set to true

            - Poison -> Poison
