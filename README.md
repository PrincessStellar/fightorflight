This version is no longer server-side only. Try CobbleGuard if you want a server-side only version.
## Cobblemon 1.7 support progress:
### Unfinished features that you might care about:
* Taunt for Pokemon.
### [Architectury](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) required!!!
# FAQ
## My Pokemon is not attacking!
* Pokemon's level should be higher than minimum_attack_level(config/fightorflight.json5). Some modpacks(*Cobbleverse!!!*) will increase the value.
* Pokemon won't attack if it's on your shoulder. However, the mounted Pokemon can attack.
* do_pokemon_defend_owner needs to be set to true.
* Pokemon will try to use the first move in its move slots to attack. It needs to be a physical/special move.
* Some other config is related to this problem, too.
# Introduction
## Major changes compared to the original version developed by Rufia:
- **Unprovoked Attack Disabled** I personally don't like this feature because the Pokemon spawns anywhere and anytime.It's quite easy to get attacked when you are doing something. However,you are free to enable it in the config.
- **Adjusted Damage Calculation** I noticed that some players commented on the curseforge page that the pokemon damage was too high, so I adjusted the damage calculation to make it more reasonable. The stat required to reach the maximum damage is also lowered to suit the lower damage.You are free to use the config to adjust the damage.
- **Configurable aggresion** Added more multipliers to adjust wild Pokemon's aggression.
- **Range attack!** Added range attack for player's pokemon. To use it, you need to choose a special attack move and make it the first move of the Pokemon's move slots.
  - Wild Pokemons are not allowed to use it(can be enabled in the config)
- **Animation Support** Support for animations from cobblemon mod when attacking(These animations are not designed for this mod so it might be weird)
- **Remove the type effects** Levitate for psychic, weakness for fight,etc. can be enabled again in the config
## More Features & Misc:
- **Different ways of range attack:** If a pokemon has some special moves,they will shoot different bullet.
  - The moves' type and power will influence the projectile's if the moves is a special move.However, if your pokemon doesn't have these moves, the type of the projectile will be based on the pokemon's primary type and the power will be set to 60(can be changed in the config).
  - Most ball and bomb moves can cause a small explosion.
  - Sound based moves and some blast moves shoots the target like the vanilla Guardian,the damage is slightly lower,but it's hard to miss.
  - The classification of the moves is not very strict.(e.g. Oblivion wing uses the mechanic of the blast moves because Yveltal shoots a beam when using this move in the core series.) It is written in the config,you can edit it yourself.
- The player's Pokemon prefers to use the first move in the move set.You can use the **Poke Staff** to select the move you want to use, even forcing a special attacker to melee!(use JEI to check the recipe)
- **Special effect for moves** 
  - The panicked pokemon can teleport to a nearby position if it learns the teleport move.(can be disabled in the config)
  - Player's pokemon will be recalled automatically when using moves like U-turn and hitting the target(melee)/shooting(range)
  - Explosive moves can cause an explosion.
  - HP draining moves can heal your Pokemon from the damage they dealt.
  - If a special attack move is a contact move,the Pokemon will use the melee instead of shooting projectiles.However the damage calculation still uses the Special Attack stat.(e.g. Draining Kiss) 
  - Most of the physical ball and bomb moves shoot a projectile instead of melee,it still uses the Attack stat to calculate the damage.(Both of the Ice Ball and Magnet Bomb are  ball and bomb moves.But I don't think Ice Ball shoots anything according to its description,while Magnet Bomb truly shoots a bomb.So using Ice Ball don't shoot anything.)
  - Pokemon gain strength after using Power-up Punch, gain weakness and resistance weakened(a new effect added by myself) after using Close Combat,etc.
    - I want to make it easy so the effect level WON'T stack like the core series.
    - Moves that can apply status conditions can apply status effects from Minecraft:
        - Burn -> Weakness & set the entity on fire.
        - Poison -> Poison
        - Badly Poison -> Poison II
        - Freeze & Sleep -> Mining Fatigue II & Slowness III & Increase the frozen time.
        - Paralysis -> Mining Fatigue & Slowness
        - Flinch -> Mining Fatigue & Slowness II
        - Confusion -> Confusion
    - Serene Grace can increase the effect to trigger the additional effect
    - Sheer Force works like the core series now.(Some moves are not supported yet. Sparkling Aria can trigger Sheer Force in Pokemon S/V, but it can't be learnt by the Pokemon which has Sheer Force, so I didn't add it.)
    - The Spike move and its variations can be used to throw spikes. If the pokemon has a target, it will spread the spikes in the target's direction; otherwise, it will spread them around itself.
- Mobs killed by your pokemon will drop items and experience like it was killed by a tamed wolf.
- Your pokemon can gain experience and ev by killing pokemon without starting a pokemon battle(needs to be **the last mob** that deals the damage,can be disabled in the config)
- Your pokemon can evolve by using the move to hit other mobs instead of starting a Pokemon Battle(e.g. Primeape needs to use Rage Fist 20 times to evolve,now you can do it without a traditional Pokemon Battle)(Configurable).
- Adds the Oran Lucky Egg(held item) to gain more experience from pokemon killed by your pokemon,right-click your pokemon while sneaking to give the item to the pokemon.(**The Oran Lucky Egg won't give you extra xp from any other ways!**)
- Your pokemon can taunt the pokemon that attacks you.(Your pokemon can't be taunted.)
  - Moves(taunt,follow me,rage powder,torment) are needed,and they need to be set as the first move in the move set. to taunt the wild pokemon.(can be disabled in the config)
- Pokemon with higher defense stat can lower the damage it take.(configurable)
- A new hotkey to let your pokemon start a battle with the pokemon that tries to attack you.
- Some abilities(intimidate,unnerve,pressure) can lower the nearby pokemon's aggro.
- The Wimpod line Pokemon will be recalled when taking damage and the health is below 50%.
- Moves like earthquake that hurts all pokemon around will hurt the entities nearby when the Pokemon hits the target.(The special moves will use the melee attack,too.)  
- **Type effectiveness for some non-pokemon entities** These effects don't strictly follow the rules of Pokemon,instead,they are more closely related to minecraft itself:
  * Water type damage will be more effective on mobs that takes damage from the water.
  * Fire type damage will be not very effective against fire immune entities(x0.1 by default,set to 0 might be confusing for new player).
  * Ice type damage will be not very effective against entities that don't take the frost damage(still x0.1).
  * Ice type damage will be more effective against entities that has a weaker resistant to the frost damage,(blaze,magma cube,etc.).
  * Poison type damage will be not very effective against undead mobs.(x0.1 again)
-Type effectiveness for Pokemon entities
-Health mechanic reworked
  - Use a mixin to replace the original max health calculation function,set shouldOverrideUpdateMaxHealth in config/fightorflight.json5 to false to disable it if you don't like the changes I made.
  - The damage a Pokemon entity takes will be dealt to the pokemon,causing the hp to drop,healing the entity will also heal the pokemon(Recommended to use with [Healing Campfire](https://modrinth.com/mod/healing-campfire)). (This feature uses some function used by my max health calculation function. Disabling the function will also disable this feature.)
- Some held item will offer damage boost(type-enhancing items,Choice Specs, Choice Band,Muscle Band,Choice Glasses,Life orb)
  - The life orb will also deal damage to the pokemon like the core series.A pokemon is immune to the damage if the pokemon's ability is Sheer Force or Magic Guard.
- The Pokemon can use some held item, like Leftovers, Black Sludge, etc.
- Ball projectiles will cause an explosion when hitting something. Explosion caused by fire type moves will ignite the ground.(I personally doesn't like mob griefing, so I disabled it by default.You need to enable it manually. Sorry about that.)
- Pokemon stops running away if the health isn't full(can be disabled in the config).
- Added multipliers for player's Pokemon to make player's Pokemon slightly stronger than the wild Pokemon
- Added a new config to disable the health sync for wild pokemon(the health sync for wild pokemon will be disabled by default)
- Options to enable friendly fire
- Failed captures will be counted as provocation.(can be disabled in the config)
- Strength and weakness can influence the pokemon's damage now(follow the Minecraft rule, mostly). Both the range attack and melee attack can benefit from this(I know these effects don't increase the damage of the projectiles in Minecraft.)
- New config options: light_dependent_unprovoked_attack: The aggression system will only work in the dark areas if enabled.(Similar to the spiders in Minecraft, enabled by default)

## TODO
- Main Goal For the Following Updates:
  * Small adjustments and fixes
- Things that might be done in a short period of time(1~3 big updates):
  - Add some features from ZA.
- Long term plans:
  - Give more special effects to different moves.
  - Special effect for abilities like aftermath,bulletproof,soundproof,etc.
  - More config options for fight of flight choices.
## Known Issues
- Damage of moves that needs the stat like electro ball can't be calculated properly.(I don't know how to find a proper way to calculate the damage if this move is used to attack a non-Pokemon mob,so I won't fix it until I figure out a way.Sorry about that.)
## How to use the Poke Staff
The old way:
1. Get one Poke Staff by crafting or get it in the creative mode.
2. Sneak+Right click: Switch the mode of the staff  
Right click:Send the command to the pokemon(send command mode)/Select the move(select mode)/select the command(select command mode)

The new way:  
1. Open the Key binds setting, find Cobblemon Fight or Flight: Poke Staff, set the key bind you like
2. Get one Poke Staff
3. Hold it in your hand, press the key to use the command. Right click with the staff will repeat the last command you use.
